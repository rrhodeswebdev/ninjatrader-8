    "# Balance Ops\n",
    "Balance implementation is buit on top of four simple concepts:\n",
    "- Hold - hold amount for order execution\n",
    "- Release - release the amount held\n",
    "- Withdraw - withdraw an asset (trading fees, orders execution)\n",
    "- Deposit - to deposit gain\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there's Release With Gain. This one is specific to Futures Balance. Since on contract purchase your money won't be withdrawn but held instead, Release With Gain is used for both 1) releasing the collateral for contracts purchased and 2) deposit the gain (or withdraw loss).  \n",
    "Here's the sample to show an order flow in terms of the balance\n",

    "**NOTE**: \n",
    "- This notebook covers implementation details, you don't need to hold/release/withdraw/deposit anything directly from within a trading strategy. It is done by FuturesBroker automatically.\n",

    "## FuturesBalance vs FuturesBalanceManager\n",
    "\n",
    "Although `FuturesBalance` provides a set of simple methods to manipulate balance, using it during orders flow tend to be quite verbose. `FuturesBalanceManager` is used instead since Apr. 16 build. This class introduces another layer of abstraction and basically used as a bridge between low-level balance operations and the concepts of orders: submission, execution, cancellation. Key differencies between these two:\n",
    "\n",
    "FuturesBalance:\n",
    "- Low level operations\n",
    "- Operates with decimals (`decimal.Decimal`)\n",
    "- Modifies the balance directly\n",
    "- Used by FuturesBalanceManager\n",
    "\n",
    "FuturesBalanceManager:\n",
    "- Higher level abstraction\n",
    "- Supports shared positions for TP/SL orders\n",
    "- Operates with orders, amounts and fill prices\n",
    "- Knows how to modify the balance in accordance with order submission/execution/cancellation\n",
    "- Relies on FuturesBalance's low-level methods to actually modify the balance\n",
    "- Used by FuturesBroker\n",
    "\n",
    "With `FuturesBalanceManager` the example above can be rewritten as follows:"
